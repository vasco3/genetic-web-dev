## Objective

To translate a mock design in PNG into ReactJS. A set of ui components (traits) will be provided. The script will attempt to put together components and will render them to see if it matches the mock design. It will try again until it looks good. Every attempt will mutate the code. The output will be a javascript file (jsx).
